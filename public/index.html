                        Insurance is protection from financial loss. It is a form of risk management, primarily used to avoid the risk of
                        something bad happening. One who provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company, or an underwriter. A
                        person who buys insurance is known as an insured or as a policyholder. The transactions cover a certain amount of your
                        bill that you need to pay for. The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be related to financial terms, and
                        usually involves something in which the insured has an insurable interest by things like ownership and possession.

                <h2>Importance of Insurance</h2>

                        Insurance is highly recommended for any individual to have. Insurance can cover costs over accidents and
                        financial issues. Insurance is important, especially once you start a family because you have to start caring for them as well.
                        Insurance is a precautionary measure taken just in case you get into a troubling situation.
